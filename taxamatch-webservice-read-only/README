ABOUT
-----------
TAXAMATCH is an algorithm for fuzzy (approximate string) matching of taxon scientific names. 
With normal exact matching, it is trivial to retrieve desired information from a taxonomic 
database, or match content across 2 or more systems, or determine that the same taxon name 
appears multiple times on a single list (deduplication). However if there is a character error 
affecting one or multiple characters in one or both names such that they do not match exactly, 
use of some sort of fuzzy match is required; TAXAMATCH is intended to fulfil that function, with 
particular tuning to the types of errors found in real world taxonomic data. Using TAXAMATCH, the 
intention is to always return candidate "true" near matches where these exist (as close as possible 
to 100% recall); suppress as many as practicable "false" near matches (high precision); and do all 
this in as short a time as possible (high efficiency), even against large reference 
datasets (>1 million names). 

The original project developed by Tony is a human interactive model made to be used much 
like a online dictionary to help identify a species.

Taxamatch Webservice is a branch aimed to provide an API JSON service based on a PHP/MySQL 
model providing the same service but focused towards data cleaning, scripting applications, 
and real time mashups.
