------------------------------------------------------------------
iPlant Collaborative made the changes listed below:
 
In the mysql database, we only kept 2 tables, genlist and splist, from the original database , and added new tables to keep the taxonomic data from MBG, and tables to store family, infraspecies names which are similar to the structure of genlist/splist, and join tables, genlist_famlist_combined, splist_genlist_combined, infra1list_splist_combined, infra2list_infra1list_combined to speed up the search.
 
In taxamatch php code, api/taxamatch.php is the entry point, we added a stub to handle the cmd=tnrs_taxamatch, which returned json data including extra meta info such as family, acceptance, etc.
We added a new class, class.tnrs_aggregator.php, in api/classes. It takes the results from original taxamatch, added those extra meta info and returned json result.
 
We made changes in 6 classes in api/classes:
In class.misc.php, we added one line in line 55 to ensure the utf8 character set: $conn->set_charset("utf8");
In class.damerau_levenshtein_mod.php, we corrected some bugs in the edit distance calculation. This has been pushed back into original repository. So only difference is some white space and comments.

In class.gni_splitter.php,
1. We added functions to enable it to communicate with the local gni parser server

2. Add functionalities to process infraspecies name.

In class.normalizer.php,
1. We removed one line which retrieved full author name from database based on abbreviation, since we don’t have those.

2. We added some line to avoid “Undefined variable” warning from php.

In class.queries.mysql.php,
1. We replaced some old queries with new queries to use the join table to speed up the search

2. We added some new queries to search family, and infraspecies

3. We added new queries to retrieve the meta info.

In class.taxamatch.php
1. We corrected a bug in function ngram, which was used to calculate author name similarity.

2. We added preprocessing steps to deal with family name, deal with annotation, make sure proper upper/lower case due to the gni parser’ sensitivity to it, detect unhyphenated trinomial.

3. We added direct search steps to avoid unnecessary taxamatch search.

4. We adjusted the threshold of maximum allowed difference in genus names from 0.2 to 0.334.

5. We added functions to process family and infraspecies.
