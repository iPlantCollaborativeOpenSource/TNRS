TNRS Simplified Darwin Core format
TNRS version 3.1, database version 3.5.4
13 November 2012

This document describes the recommended export format for taxonomic data that will be added as a taxonomic 
source to the TNRS database (Taxonomic Name Resolution Service, http://tnrs.iplantcollaborative.org/).

Most data elements and their names are identical to Darwin Core (DwC) Taxon terms, as described at 
http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm. A few elements not included in the current version of DwC have been 
added; these are indicated by an asterisk (*). 

If you will be providing your taxonomic data as a stand-alone file (as opposed to a database table via  
server connection), please save the file as plain-text utf8 to preserve all accented characters. Avoid 
opening or editing the file in Excel; this usually results in corruption of utf8 or extended ascii 
characters. The text file can be either tab-delimited or comma-delimited (.csv).

Your file must have following columns in the order shown. The first line of the file should be a header
line (the column names). Even if you do not use one of the optional columns, include it in the header line
and leave its column blank.  See also the example tab-delimited file "tnrs_dwc_example.txt"

taxonID				Required. Unique identifier for each taxon (name). Can be character 
					or numeric. MUST be unique for each record. 
parentNameUsageID	        Link to identifier (taxonID) of most proximate parent taxon. Required
					for any taxon that has a parent. Taxa without a parent will be linked
					to the root. Orphan parentNameUsageIDs (linking to nonexistent taxonIDs)
					will be linked to the root. WARNING: circular parentNameUsageID-taxonID
					links will cause database loading to fail.
taxonRank			Required. Differs slight from DwC specification in that this is the 
					fully spelled (not abbreviated) English name of the rank of the taxon. 
					You MUST use the following controlled vocabulary (similar to 
					http://code.google.com/p/darwincore/wiki/Taxon#taxonRank, under 
					column "English", except "forma" instead of "form", more
					extensive vocabulary): kingdom, subkingdom, 
					superdivision, division, subdivision, superclass, class, subclass, 
					order, suborder, family, subfamily, tribe, subtribe, section, 
					subsection, series, subseries, genus, subgenus, species, subspecies,
					variety, subvariety, forma, subforma, cultivar, unranked
family				Optional as long as family is included under scientificName 
					(with taxonRank='family'), and all immediate children in that family
					are linked to it via parentNameUsageID.
scientificName		        Required. The fully formed scientific name, without the authority.
scientificNameAuthorship	Optional but strongly recommended. This is the terminal 
					authority of the taxon; please do not include internal authorities 
					(for example, if the name is a subspecies, this should be the 
					authority for the subspecies, not the species. Required if your list 
					contains homonyms (duplicate names disambiguated only by authority).
genusHybridMarker	       *Optional but recommended. Leave blank if not a hybrid name. The TNRS 
					loading scripts should detect most hybrids, but it is safer to mark
					them yourself.
genus			       Required if taxon of rank genus or lower.
speciesHybridMarker	      *Optional but recommended. Leave blank if not a hybrid name. The TNRS 
					loading scripts will detect most hybrids.
specificEpithet		       Required if taxon at rank of species or lower. Just the epithet; do not
					include the genus portion of a species name. Leave blank for hybrid
					formula names (e.g., Adiantum latifolium x petiolatum).
infraspecificRank	       *Required if name is an infraspecific trinomial (e.g., 
					"Poa annua var. supina"). This is the abbreviated rank indicator 
					included in names of subspecies, varieties, etc. Not directly 
					equivalent to any Darwin Core term. Controlled vocabulary as per 
					abbreviations as used in the ICBN Vienna code 
					(http://ibot.sav.sk/icbn/main.htm; see esp. Section 5): 
					"subsp.", "var.", "subvar.", "fo.", "subfo.", "cv.".
					The TNRS will attempt to parse this value from the scientificName if 
					column infraspecificRank is left blank. The TNRS has an extensive 
					library of infraspecific rank indicators and their variants and will 
					attempt to standardize any variant abbreviations. Leave blank if taxon
					is at rank of species or higher. 
infraspecificEpithet	     Required if taxon is subspecies, variety, forma, etc.  Subgeneric 
					taxa such as section and series (e.g., Psychotria sect. Notopleura) 
					can be entered by leaving specificEpithet NULL, entering the rank 
					indicator in infraspecificRank and epithet infraspecificEpithet.
infraspecificRank2	     *Required if name is an infraspecific quadrinomial (e.g., 
					"Silene laciniata ssp. major var. angustifolia"). Used for taxa of
					ranks variety, forma, subforma, etc. Not directly 
					equivalent to any Darwin Core term. Controlled vocabulary as per 
					abbreviations as used in the ICBN Vienna Code 
					(http://ibot.sav.sk/icbn/main.htm; see esp. Section 5): 
					"var.", "subvar.", "fo.", "subfo.".
infraspecificEpithet2	    *Required if taxon is an infraspecific quadrinomial (see 
					infraspecificRank2, above). Not directly equivalent to any Darwin Core
					term. If used, infraspecificRank2 as well as all higher taxonomic name 
					component fields must be populated.
taxonomicStatus		   Indications of simple taxonomic status. If name is a synonym, more detailed
					reason for (nomenclaturally) invalid or illegitimate names can be used. 
					If left NULL, TNRS will treat name as "No opinion". Current controlled 
					vocabulary supported: 
					"Accepted", "Synonym", "Invalid", "Illegitimate", NULL.
acceptedNameUsageID	    Optional but recommended if taxonomicStatus="Synonym", "Invalid", or 
					"Illegitimate". Link to taxonID of accepted name. 
taxonUri			Optional. Hyperlink to name in original database.
lsid				Optional. LSID, if known. If you don't know what this is, don't worry
					about it.

If your taxonomic source list contains only concatenated names, use the TNRS in parse-only 
mode to break the names into their atomic components (http://tnrs.iplantcollaborative.org/TNRSapp.html).
