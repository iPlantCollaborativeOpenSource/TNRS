ABOUT
-----------
TAXAMATCH is an algorithm for fuzzy (approximate string) matching of 
taxon scientific names. With normal exact matching, it is trivial to 
retrieve desired information from a taxonomic database, or match 
content across 2 or more systems, or determine that the same taxon 
name appears multiple times on a single list (deduplication). However 
if there is a character error affecting one or multiple characters 
in one or both names such that they do not match exactly, use of some 
sort of fuzzy match is required; TAXAMATCH is intended to fulfil that 
function, with particular tuning to the types of errors found in real 
world taxonomic data. Using TAXAMATCH, the intention is to always 
return candidate "true" near matches where these exist (as close as 
possible to 100% recall); suppress as many as practicable "false" 
near matches (high precision); and do all this in as short a time as 
possible (high efficiency), even against large reference datasets 
(>1 million names). 

The original project developed by Tony is a human interactive model 
made to be used much like a online dictionary to help identify a 
species.

Taxamatch Webservice is a branch aimed to provide an API JSON service 
based on a PHP/MySQL model providing the same service but focused 
towards data cleaning, scripting applications, and real time mashups.
